<p>Each team will make new parts during iGEM and will submit them to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. The iGEM software provides an easy way to present the parts your team has created. The <code>&lt;groupparts&gt;</code> tag (see below) will generate a table with all of the parts that your team adds to your team sandbox.</p>
<p>Remember that the goal of proper part documentation is to describe and define a part, so that it can be used without needing to refer to the primary literature. Registry users in future years should be able to read your documentation and be able to use the part successfully. Also, you should provide proper references to acknowledge previous authors and to provide for users who wish to know more.</p>

<h5>Note</h5>
<p>Note that parts must be documented on the <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page"> Registry</a>. This page serves to <i>showcase</i> the parts you have made. Future teams and other users and are much more likely to find parts by looking in the Registry than by looking at your team wiki.</p>

<h5>Adding parts to the registry</h5>
<p>You can add parts to the Registry at our <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Add_a_Part_to_the_Registry">Add a Part to the Registry</a> link.</p>
<p>We encourage teams to start completing documentation for their parts on the Registry as soon as you have it available. The sooner you put up your parts, the better you will remember all the details about your parts. Remember, you don't need to send us the DNA sample before you create an entry for a part on the Registry. (However, you <b>do</b> need to send us the DNA sample before the Jamboree. If you don't send us a DNA sample of a part, that part will not be eligible for awards and medal criteria.)</p>

<h5>What information do I need to start putting my parts on the Registry?</h5>
<p>The information needed to initially create a part on the Registry is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part Name</li>
<li>Part type</li>
<li>Creator</li>
<li>Sequence</li>
<li>Short Description (60 characters on what the DNA does)</li>
<li>Long Description (Longer description of what the DNA does)</li>
<li>Design considerations</li>
</ul>

<p>
We encourage you to put up <em>much more</em> information as you gather it over the summer. If you have images, plots, characterization data and other information, please also put it up on the part page. </p>

<h5>Inspiration</h5>
<p>We have a created  a <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Well_Documented_Parts">collection of well documented parts</a> that can help you get started.</p>

<p> You can also take a look at how other teams have documented their parts in their wiki:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:MIT/Parts"> 2014 MIT </a></li>
<li><a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:Heidelberg/Parts"> 2014 Heidelberg</a></li>
<li><a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:Tokyo_Tech/Parts">2014 Tokyo Tech</a></li>
